# Hello!

## Today:

- Look at new processing sketches you've made
- Talk about loops
- Functions
- Arrays

"Empty Words is a system for typesetting and producing text-based posters consisting of only holes.

Using a gently modified standard vinyl cutter and a custom made software interface, each hole is cut in sequence at a controlled speed. Similar to a Linotype machine, the resulting setup becomes a tool for the production of textual works."

"With Connections No.5, I worked with the principles of “body and physicalness, movement, play, lightness, empty space and curiousity.”

## What are Functions?
- Functions are a means of taking the parts of our program and separating them
into modular pieces, making the code easier to read and understand (making your
future self happier) as well as revise
- They perform tasks or calculations (aka procedures or methods)
- Calling a function is same as writing line(), rect(), fill(). (these are
built-in functions) vs. user-defined functions
- modularity - functions break down larger programs into smaller parts - makes
code more manageable and readable
- reusability- allows us to code without having to retype everything
- 3 parts: return type(void, int, float, boolean), function name(whatever you want), arguments (parameters or values , passed into the function (variable declaration)
- written like:
returnType functionName(arguments){
 //code body of function
}

## Arrays
An array is a list of variables that share a common name. Arrays are useful because they make it possible to work with more
variables without creating a new name for each one. This makes the code shorter, easier to read, and more convenient to
update.
- useful when a program has many elements to keep track of
- Each item in an array is called an element, and each has an index value to mark its position within the array. Just like
coordinates on the canvas, index values for an array start counting from 0.

## Creative Process Journal

This is really meant to help you keep track of your progression. Start doing researching towards your final project. The final project will be largely lead by your own personal interests and desires, utilizing new acquired skills. Read the reading about what a creative process journal in in this weeks resource folder. Let that guide you. This will also help when you present your final project.

## Project 2: Systems: World, Body, Machine

Using a combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a system that has many (maybe even infinite) number of outcomes. It can be a game, drawing generator, non-linear story, or anything you can dream up. Do something personally exciting to you.

Think about social systems, cultural algorithms, and codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale. Design your own system that addresses your relationship to these. Think about physical interface and installation of the work. We will be learning physical computing next, so you can consider making something that is a physical bridge to the more screen based programming we have been doing.

## Resources

### Generative Type

I know many of you are interested in Generative Type. I am granting you access to log in to Creative Applications with my credentials (bc it costs money)

- username: aagricola
- password: expandeddesign

[This is a wonderful tutorial](http://www.creativeapplications.net/processing/generative-typography-processing-tutorial/) created by Amnon Owed with extensive lessons in using Processing to create generative text. The first few Image Based examples should be understandable based on what we have learned in class.

## Homework

- [Arduino Uno](https://www.adafruit.com/product/50) and [A-B USB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/62)
- Make a pattern or a generative font using loops, functions, and Arrays. Look through
- Begin a Creative Process Journal; you can use any blog site or just start a document, website, or slideshow.
- Readings
  - [Interesting article on the addictive nature of technology](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia)
  - Sherry Turkle's "Thinking of Yourself as a Machine" -- We will discuss **Nov. 1**
