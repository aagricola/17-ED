# Hello!

## Today:
- Look at homeworks
- Analog input from Arduino
- Analog output to Arduino
- Serial input and output

## Analog Input and Output

[Presentation on Analog Input and Output](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BhNyA6jWcWhAaleHbIvDaak23S0KEZxa4m57XQX4VVc/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000&slide=id.p)

Our micro controller communicates with the computer via serial communication. Each time we serial.println , we are sending several bytes of data as an ASCII-encoded numeric string with a carriage return and newline at the end.

Serial.write sends raw binary value — that is, a single byte ranging from 0 to 255.

[Here is a video that explains what in the hell I'm talking about](https://vimeo.com/97519477)

"The migration from analogue to digital broadcasting at the end of 2008 freed most of the frequency bands previously used for airing TV programs, marking a significant transformation of media and the end of analogue broadcasting. Creating a scenario of public engagement, the visitor through riding the bicycle facilitates a low power signal within the now redundant band broadcasted out into the local vicinity of the museum. The signal consists of an animation generated by a small computer running Flood Fill, an algorithm that renders an animation of black and white pixels appearing almost as alignment of the snow-like fuzz received when the channel is dormant."

## Homework

- Assignments:
  - Analog input (sensor or potentiometer) controlling something on-screen
  - Something on-screen controlling LED light(s) using analogWrite
- CPJ - next week share your research in the morning "round robin"
