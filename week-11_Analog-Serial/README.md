## Serial Communication

### Difference between Serial.print and Serial.write:

Our micro controller communicates with the computer via serial communication. Each time we serial.println , we are sending several bytes of data as an ASCII-encoded numeric string with a carriage return and newline at the end.

Serial.write sends raw binary value â€” that is, a single byte ranging from 0 to 255.
