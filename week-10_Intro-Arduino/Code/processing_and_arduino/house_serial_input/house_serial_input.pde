// Using digital input from Arduino to Processing. 
//Example based on arduino_input, which is included with the Arduino for Processing library
/*
To use:
* Using the Arduino software, upload the StandardFirmata example (located in Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata) to your Arduino board.
* look at the list of serial ports printed in the message area below. Note the index of the port corresponding to your Arduino board (the numbering starts at 0).
* Modify the "arduino = new Arduino(...)" line below, changing the number in Arduino.list()[0] to the number corresponding to the serial port of your Arduino board.
