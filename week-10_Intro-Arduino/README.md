[FOMO Survival Kit](https://vimeo.com/184654093), by Lara Defayes, 2016

"Fomo stand for fear of missing out. It is a compulsive concern that one might miss something like an opportunity or satisfying event, often aroused by our close relationship with social media websites. Imagine yourself alone in the wild city, going through a well deserved digital detox but yet hungry for new social interactions. Is there any way to find your path to the next event planned in your calendar?"

-Laura Defayes

## Creative Process Journal

Read the article in our code folder about what this is. This is really meant to help you keep track of your progression. Start doing researching towards your final project. The final project will be largely lead by your own personal interests and desires, utilizing new acquired skills. Let that guide you. This will also help when you present your final project.

## Project 2: Systems: World, Body, Machine

Using a combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a system that has many (maybe even infinite) number of outcomes. It can be a game, drawing generator, non-linear story, or anything you can dream up. Do something personally exciting to you.

Think about social systems, cultural algorithms, and codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale. Design your own system that addresses your relationship to these. Think about physical interface and installation of the work. We will be learning physical computing next, so you can consider making something that is a physical bridge to the more screen based programming we have been doing.

## Homework

- Finish your Assignments
  - pushbutton controlling something on screen
  - something on screen control LED
- Bring your arduino kit with you next week
- MEET IN U102 NEXT WEEK! We will be meeting there for the rest of the semester. 9am still.
- Keep up with your CPJ, researching and exploring inspiration for your final projecct (ref. to last week's post if this statement confuses you)
