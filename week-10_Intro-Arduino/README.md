[FOMO Survival Kit](https://vimeo.com/184654093), by Lara Defayes, 2016

"Fomo stand for fear of missing out. It is a compulsive concern that one might miss something like an opportunity or satisfying event, often aroused by our close relationship with social media websites. Imagine yourself alone in the wild city, going through a well deserved digital detox but yet hungry for new social interactions. Is there any way to find your path to the next event planned in your calendar?"

-Laura Defayes
