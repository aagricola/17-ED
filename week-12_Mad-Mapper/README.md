# Hello!

## Today:
- Look at Homework & CPJ
- Upload to Canvas
- Syphon to MadMapper
- Processing Animation
- Bare Controller as MIDI to MadMapper

## Project 2: Systems: World, Body, Machine

Using a combination of skills developed in class and through personal research, design a system that has many (maybe even infinite) number of outcomes. It can be a game, drawing generator, non-linear story, or anything you can dream up. Do something personally exciting to you.

Think about social systems, cultural algorithms, and codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale. Design your own system that addresses your relationship to these. Think about physical interface and installation of the work. Consider making something that is a physical bridge or interface to the more screen based programming we have been doing.

## Creative Interface

"Millions of crowdworkers are helping the digital world run smoothly by solving the problems that computers can’t solve just yet. Among many other tasks they categorize images, transcribe texts and filter out explicit content. Ironically, by doing so they also train the algorithms which will replace them eventually.

How would everyday life be affected if this digital piecework was woven into it? The Bachelor thesis project Human Element Inc. explores this question through three speculative crowdwork services."

 Incontroller is a game designed where the difficulty level in the game increases in the controller while the software remains the same.

 ## Projection Mapping Workshop

 "By contrasting the oldest form of image reproduction (woodcutting) with the most recent digital technologies, the installation straddles centuries and contracts time.”

["In Order to Control"](http://www.notabenevisual.com/#/works/in-order-to-control/), by NOTA BENE (multi-disciplinary studio based in Istanbul, specialized in digital experiences with the newest technology for global brands & artistic platforms by focussing on video projection mapping, interactive experiences and installations.)

"As viewers access the space and their shadows cover the words on the floor, which were then projected on the wall instead. In order to make sense of the text, the viewer has to move and possibly to join arms with other viewers.
They designed the installation in a way that calls for the viewer’s complete engagement of body and mind. In fact, the ethical question behind the work addresses our capacities to ‘move’ and take action in our controversial society."

1. Make an animation using Processing
2. Make a trigger button to projection map with the Animation

Mad Mapper:
1. Add the Animation
2. Set it to loop once
3. Upload “Midi_interface_generic” to the Bare controller
4. Plan the electrodes - layout the buttons. connect to copper tape on the back with a nail or wire or pin.
5. Open the MIDI control settings in Mad Mapper. Select the animation you want to control with the Touch Board, then click the “Goto beginning” button, then touch the electrode you want to use, for example, electrode 0. The “Goto beginning” button should now be grey and have something written across it.
6. Paint the button.
