# Hello!

## Today:
- Object examples
- Basic electronics slideshow
- Make conductive paint
- Design and create your own paper circuits

## Why Use Objects
- Objects are a way to group variables with related functions.
- They break up your ideas into building blocks
- They make it easier to write smaller pieces to make up a more complicated structure
- The idea is to group related data (properties) with related methods that act on that data.

In the context of objects, a variable is called a **property** (or instance variable)
A function is called a **method**.

## Conductive Installation

collaboration between bare conductive, Fabio Antinori and Alicja Pytlewska to create an installation that combines screenprinting, capacitive sensing, interactive tapestries and generative soundscape, as a large-scale metaphor for the idea of breathing life into a textile skin.

3 Touch Boards by Bare Conductive programmed in Arduino are controlling 30 sensors screenprinted by K2 London with Bare Conductive Electric Paint on the 3 tapestries made out of Tyvek sheets. A custom code written in MaxMSP generates the soundscape by reading weather related data from yahoo weather; the code modulates different part of the soundscape in relation to the level of interaction happening on the tapestries and in response to the readings from the 30 sensors.
