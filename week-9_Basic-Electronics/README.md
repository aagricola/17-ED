collaboration between bare conductive, Fabio Antinori and Alicja Pytlewska to create an installation that combines screenprinting, capacitive sensing, interactive tapestries and generative soundscape, as a large-scale metaphor for the idea of breathing life into a textile skin.

3 Touch Boards by Bare Conductive programmed in Arduino are controlling 30 sensors screenprinted by K2 London with Bare Conductive Electric Paint on the 3 tapestries made out of Tyvek sheets. A custom code written in MaxMSP generates the soundscape by reading weather related data from yahoo weather; the code modulates different part of the soundscape in relation to the level of interaction happening on the tapestries and in response to the readings from the 30 sensors.
