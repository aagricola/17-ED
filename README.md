## Expanded Design

### Course Description

This hands on course introduces students to a variety of topics related to expanded design, rapid prototyping, and interactivity through tutorials, workshops, collaborative experimentation, and guided studio time. The course will survey design centric techniques to utilize 3D softwares, Arduino/Processing and time-based media for the web. Students will learn how to prepare files for digital fabrication and prototyping via Illustrator and Rhino with 3d printers and laser cutters. In this class, students will learn to bridge to digital, screen-based world with physical, design objects. Lectures, visiting artists and readings will provide a cultural and technical framework for process-based projects. This course is open to novices and to those seeking to expand their practice by incorporating elements of interactivity.

## Important Things to Remember
- Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
- Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
-  Come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
-  Participation and collaboration are integral parts of this class's culture. Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
- You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.
