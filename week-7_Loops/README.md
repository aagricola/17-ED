## Today

I apologize, but due to sickness, we will not have class today.

I would still like for you to still progress with Processing though, so I have put together some resources for you to learn about loops from.

We can touch on these concepts again next week if you want, or you can email me with any questions you might have.

## Repetition

Repetition is a huge part of the language of computing. We see patterns in graphic design, in nature, in music, and pretty much everywhere we look.

["Here to There"](http://zanyparade.com/v8/projects.php?id=17), Emily Gobeille and Theodore Watson, 2008
This is from a series of large format posters for children that combine science, nature, algorithm and design, to feed their imagination and curiosity. You can see a balance of hand illustration and generated pattern in these. They developed a suite of software tools using openFrameworks to programmatically build elements of visual stories being told.

"I was trying to find a unique way of using the computer and software to create geometric images." -Mark Wilson

"13/9/65 Nr. 2 ("Hommage à Paul Klee")", Frieder Nake, 1965

Nake lists the random elements of this work. They are:
- Change of original width of the horizontal bands (at the left boundary)
- The “buckling” of the horizontal bands as they extend from left to right, but so that they never intersect
- For each quadrilateral that is generated as part of one horizontal band, a random decision is made: it is left empty, or filled by vertical lines, or by triangles
- The number of signs per quadrilateral (vertical lines or triangles)
- Positions of those signs per quadrilateral
- Additionally, the number of circles
- Position of each circle
- Size (radius) of the circles Size: 50 × 50 cm
- Signed lower left: Nake/ER56/Z64 (automaticly drawn signature)

This iconic generative pattern was created in response to Klee's "Hauptweg und Nebenwege"

["Wooden Mirror"](http://www.smoothware.com/danny/woodenmirror.html), Daniel Rozin, 1999

"830 square pieces of wood, 830 servo motors, control electronics, video camera, computer, wood frame.
Size - W 67” x H 80” x D 10” (170cm , 203cm, 25cm).
Built in 1999, this is the first mechanical mirror I built. This piece explores the line between digital and physical, using a warm and natural material such as wood to portray the abstract notion of digital pixels."

## Repeat Loops

- comes in handy when you want to use a few lines of code to do something over and over and over
- these are great if you want to generate patterns
- good for creating gridded games
- also used in image processing

## Homework
- Watch the above videos about while and for loops.  If you're really into it, go ahead and watch the following two videos he has on functions!

- Create a visual pattern using for loops. It can be of your own design, or if you are having trouble thinking of something, make a "Master Copy" of one of the algorist's computer generated patterns.
