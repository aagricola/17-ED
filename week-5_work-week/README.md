"Frame Blocks", by B6, a Japanese design studio

**Project 1** _ Modularity: “Modularity involves the arrangement of one or more elements to produce a multitude of forms.” Design something made of fixed parts that can be recombined in multiple configurations. Digitally fabricate the forms so that they can be played with. Use any of the new tools we have learned for the design - Processing, Rhino, Grasshopper, or a combination. You can always return to Illustrator as well, but I would like for you to try to define parameters that are repeatable (refer to this week's reading on repetition for inspiration). Due: Next Week!
