### DFab Work Day!

We don't have to get very complicated to create a big impact with design...

Our you could get very complicated to express your idea. The following project is a clever and funny use of motors, physical computing, and digital fabrication to create an "Electric Knife Orchestra" by Neil Mendoza.

**Reminder:** This saturday, 3pm-5pm, is the workshop with Paul Mirel here in the Dfab Lab on sensors, motors and Arduino controls! Bring your Arduino if you have one. 5-6 pm is free play.

"Frame Blocks", by B6, a Japanese design studio

**Project 1** _ Modularity: “Modularity involves the arrangement of one or more elements to produce a multitude of forms.” Design something made of fixed parts that can be recombined in multiple configurations. Digitally fabricate the forms so that they can be played with. Use any of the new tools we have learned for the design - Processing, Rhino, Grasshopper, or a combination. You can always return to Illustrator as well, but I would like for you to try to define parameters that are repeatable (refer to this week's reading on repetition for inspiration). Due: Next Week!

## Public Events at MICA

**Tuesday (10/03) 7pm, Dolphin 2F: Bonnie Crawford**:
A Baltimore-based artist named Bonnie Crawford will be doing a class visit with Robotic Arts Intro and giving a public talk at 7pm out in the main lab on the 2nd floor of Dolphin. Her work is very tactile, mixing drawings, found objects, and hand sewn pieces with freeform electronics. Really good stuff.

**Tuesday 10/03, 4pm, Falvey Hall:** international speaker visiting MICA named Xu Bing! Try to make both if you can!
