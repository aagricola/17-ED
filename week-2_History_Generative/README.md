# Welcome Back!

## Today we will
- Look at homework (Submit an image file through Canvas)
- Learn some history of Computational Art
- Processing examples

## Generative Art
Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art. -Wikipedia
## Non-computational Systems in Art
The following are a few artists who implement systems or instructions and allow the work to be generated by that. This allows for chance or random variations to be a big creative factor. Think about how you might use instructions in your work. [How] Does the viewer play a role?

Hans Haacke, "Condensation Cube", 1965

Hans Haacke's early work investigates naturally occuring systems. This piece embodies a physical occurrence, of the condensation cycle, in real time. Haacke's interest in real-time systems propelled him into his criticism of social and political systems in his later work.

"Life is not just about matter and how it immediately interacts with itself but also how that matter interacts in interconnected systems that include organisms in their separately perceiving worlds – worlds that are necessarily incomplete, even for scientists and philosophers who, like there objects of study, form only a tiny part of the giant perhaps infinite universe they observe”
-Dorian Sagan, A Foray into the Worlds of Animals and Humans, with a Theory of Meaning, 1934)

_"The computer helps, but it does not 'do', does not 'design' or 'invent' anything."

"My computer-aided procedure is simply a systematization of the traditional approach. ...In spite of their advantages, computers, no more than other simpler tools, do not guarantee that a work of art of good quality will result, for it is an artist's skill that is the decisive factor" -Vera Molnar_

## Assignment
Add interactivity to your portrait sketch or create a new generative drawing machine inspired by the chaos of life. Use what we learned today in class and attempt to incorporate something new from the reference section or from another example you find online.

## Homework
- Reading in the resources folder: "Future of Making"
- Watch section 6 of Lynda tutorial on [Rhino 5 Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Rhino-tutorials/Understanding-lines-polylines/133324/153910-4.html)
