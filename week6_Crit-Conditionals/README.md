## Conditional statements

Conditionals allow the draw loop to execute differently depending on something that is happening in the code. So the code can take different paths depending on whether certain conditions have been met and return true or false.

Else if statements execute something totally different if the if statement returns false.

We will use operators : && (and) , || (or) , == (equal to), != (not equal to)

We will look at (mousePressed) to check if the user is holding down the mouse. This is different from using events (functions) like function mousePressed() or function keyPressed() which changes a state permanently.

We will use a boolean to create a toggle switch

And a few other things you will find in today's examples:
  - keyboard events
  - pfont
  - export
  - import svg

## History of Non-linear Stories

  “Access to computers and the Internet completely changed the way that I consumed information and organized ideas in my head. I saw information stacked on top of itself in simultaneity, no longer confined to spatiotemporal dimensions of the book.”  – Krystal South , quote from idyrslf.com

  Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written between 1977 and 1979. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.

  olia lialina,_ my boyfriend came back from the war_ (m.b.c.b.f.t.w.)

  It tells the story of two lovers who reunite after an unspecified conflict. Fragments of dialogue convey the difficulty they have reconnecting, though not explicitly stated. She approaches the web as a medium similar to film. She calls it a netfilm. The flow splits and digresses into multiple threads, similar to a cinematic montage in which separate simultaneous actions are edited to produce the effect of simultaneity.

  Based in Seoul, South Korea,Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries, composed of the Korean Young-hae Chang and the American Marc Voge, combine text with jazz music with Flash productions in which they use solely the Monaco font. In these works they are breaking the Internet tendency to emphasize interactivity and foregrounding photo’s, illustrations and excessive use of colors.

   ## In Class Assignment: Non-linear story
   Using the skills we have learned in class so far, create a Non-linear story. Don't spend too much time on this. It is really just to put conditional logic into practice, so use one or two buttons.
