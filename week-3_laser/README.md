# Welcome to the DFab Lab
## Today we will:
- Learn to Import from Illustrator to Rhino
- Learn 2D design basics in Rhino
- Begin a new Assignment
- Introduction to best laser cutter practices

You don't have to look very far these days to find artists and designers employing digital fabrication in their work. Laser cutting is being utilised

in **graphic design**

## Intro to Rhino

Read through the [dfab manual](http://staff.mica.edu/rmckibbin/Images/Manual.pdf)

[The Rhino website](https://wiki.mcneel.com/rhino/home) has some easy follow along tutorials. I recommend these if you want to go further with modeling to watch and follow along.

## Laser Cutting
We will be learning the best methods for using the Universal Laser Cutters.

When you are modeling you will use a different layer for different types of cuts:

 - Etch = red
 - Cut = blue
 - Raster Engrave = green
 - Test = magenta
 - Modeling = black (no cut)

Set Properties: When you are finished with your design in Rhino, you will go to File > Print

 1.  Set scale to 1:1
 2.  Select your window
 3.  Go into Properties
 4.  Select all properties and set to Speed = 15, Power = 15, PPi = 200 (this sets a base line)
 5. Turn Air Assist on: Flow = Air , Flowrate = 50%
 6. Measure your material with a caliper
 7. **Set your Z based on the thickness of your material.** (Measure with a caliper) WARNING: if you miss this step, you could break the laser and it is VERY VERY VERY expensive to replace.

Cut order is based on the order listed. Always have the raster engraving and etching happen before the cutting. You can change the order by clicking and dragging.
Less power is how you reduce burn
For wood you can set PPI to 200, for plexi you can set it to 1000. **Consult the notebook next to the computer for other material guidelines, but always do your own tests before you cut your design.**

**Test Cutting:** Always start with a setting that is too low, and run a series of tests on your actual material increasing power or (decreasing speed to increase the effective power) until you reach a setting that cuts through but does not start a flame.
I use a small circle and start with the base line settings and increase the power until I get the desired cut. Here are a few of the cut settings I made:
Cardboard: Power = 30, Speed = 12, PPI = 200
Plexi: Power = 100, Speed = 15, and PPI= 1000
Canvas: Power = 50, Speed = 20, PPI= 200
Felt: Power = 12, Speed = 15, PPI= 200
Cotton: Power = 15, Speed = 15, PPI= 200

8. Send to Cut
9. **Turn on the exhaust** (big green button) on the wall.
10. Place your material.
11. Log onto the computer and open your file
12. Print and set your print settings
13. This is where you will first run your test cut
14. Press Print
15. Open the Universal Laser Control Panel
16. Use the move tool if necessary to move your file
17. Check the alignment of the laser
18. Calculate your cut time
19. Press the big play button
**Watch it cut!**
*NEVER LEAVE THE MACHINE CUTTING UNATTENDED.

Materials: Anything on the Paper, mat board, card stock, Cardboard, chipboard, Plexiglas, organic fabrics (spray lightly with water first), solid wood, plywood (fewer plys is better), cork.
If you would like to cut a material that is not on this list, please stop in during office hours, or contact the Digital Fabrication Studios Manager, Ryan McKibbin.

[Here is some more information](http://staff.mica.edu/rmckibbin/Lasers.html) on the laser cutter's from Ryan McKibbin including a tutorial in case you ever need a refresher.

IF YOU'RE UNSURE ABOUT ANYTHING, ASK! If the lab is open, there will always be a tech on duty willing to answer simple questions and concerns.
IF ANYTHING BREAKS let someone know. You will not get in trouble, and it is more helpful to know right away so that it can be fixed ASAP.

[Inventables](https://www.inventables.com/) is a great resource for plexiglass as well as project inspirations

## Assignment 2: Plant Marker

Design a plant marker for the plant that you chose. You can make it how you want, but please include the plant name and the Latin name.   

## Project 1: Modularity
“Modularity involves the arrangement of one
or more elements to produce a multitude of
forms.” Design something made of fixed parts that can
be recombined in multiple configurations.
Digitally fabricate the forms so that they can
be played with. Use any of the new tools
we have learned for the design - Processing,
Rhino, Grasshopper, or a combination. You can
always return to Illustrator as well, but I would like for you to try to define parameters that are repeatable (refer back to last weeks reading for inspiration).
Due: Oct. 4

## Homework
- Finish Assignment 2: Plant marker
- Sketch ideas for Project 1
- Optional: Continue watching Rhino tutorials
